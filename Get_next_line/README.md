## 42 - Get_next_line

The goal of this project is to create the function get_next_line.c which, when called in a loop, will then allow the available text in the file descriptor to be read one line at a time until the end of the file.

## Usage

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```shell
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c || get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
```
