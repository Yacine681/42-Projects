# 42 School - Piscine

Welcome to my repository with all the exercises I did during the "pool" at School 42. The pool is a unique and intense coding experience where students immerse themselves in the fundamentals of programming, particularly in the C language.

## About the Piscine

The 42 piscine is a coding bootcamp-style program designed to introduce students to the world of software development. It's an intensive and immersive period where participants engage in daily programming challenges and projects. The objective is not just to learn syntax and concepts but also to develop problem-solving skills, resilience, and teamwork.
